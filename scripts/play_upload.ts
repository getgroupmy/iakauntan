/**
 * Upload an Android App Bundle to Google Play.
 *
 *     deno run --allow-read --allow-env --allow-net \
 *       scripts/play_upload.ts <bundle.aab>
 *
 * The Play equivalent of `xcrun altool --upload-app`, except that Google
 * ships no CLI for it -- the documented route is the Publishing API, and
 * the usual answer is fastlane. This is a hundred lines instead of a Ruby
 * toolchain, for the same reason `ios-release.yml` calls `xcodebuild`
 * directly: a second vendor is a second place the signing key lives.
 *
 * ## The edit is a transaction
 *
 * Nothing happens until the commit. `edits.insert` opens one, the bundle
 * and the track assignment go inside it, and `edits.commit` applies the
 * lot. A run that dies halfway leaves the edit abandoned rather than the
 * app half-released, and an abandoned edit expires on its own -- which is
 * why there is no cleanup here and no attempt to reuse one.
 *
 * ## What it reads
 *
 *   PLAY_SERVICE_ACCOUNT  the whole service account JSON
 *   PLAY_PACKAGE_NAME     my.iakauntan.iakauntan
 *   PLAY_TRACK            internal | alpha | beta | production
 *   PLAY_RELEASE_NOTES    optional, one line, shown to testers
