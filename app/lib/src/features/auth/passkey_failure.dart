/// The platform files answer `null` when somebody dismissed the prompt,

/// the app arguing with you. But not every unhappy ending is a
/// dismissal, and the two must not be collapsed.
///
/// On a phone the common one is a domain that is not associated with
/// the app — no `assetlinks.json` on Android, no
/// `apple-app-site-association` on iOS, or one that does not name this
/// build. The system then refuses the ceremony outright, and it looks
/// from the outside exactly like a button that does nothing. That is
/// the worst possible presentation of a build-configuration mistake:
/// silent, on the sign-in screen, for everyone.
///
/// So the mobile implementation throws this instead, and
/// `signInWithPasskey` turns it into a message. The browser has no
/// equivalent — WebAuthn reports a dismissal and a refusal with the
/// same `NotAllowedError`, deliberately, so that a page cannot learn
/// which it was — so nothing on web throws this.
