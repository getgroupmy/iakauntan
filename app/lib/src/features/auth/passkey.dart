// ignore_for_file: experimental_member_use
//
// `auth.passkey` is marked `@experimental` in `gotrue`, and the
// analyzer started enforcing that across package boundaries on the SDK
// this repository now pins -- eight warnings, which
// `--fatal-warnings` makes eight errors.
//
// Silenced rather than worked around, because the annotation is
// telling the truth and the truth is already written down:
// `docs/passkeys.md` says passkeys are a BETA feature of the project,
// names the dashboard menu they live under, and warns that the
// relying party ID cannot be changed later without invalidating every
// key already enrolled. There is no stable alternative to move to --
// GoTrue is the only thing that can verify a WebAuthn assertion for
// this project -- so the choice is this API or no passkeys at all.
//
// FILE-level and not line-level on purpose: everything in this file is
// about passkeys, so a per-line ignore would be the same decision
// repeated with more places to forget it. If a call to something else
// experimental ever lands here, it belongs in its own file anyway.
//
// What to do when `gotrue` stabilises it: delete this, and the
// analyzer will say so by having nothing to report.
/// Signing in with a passkey.
///
/// GoTrue does the hard half. `auth.passkey.startAuthentication()`
/// returns a challenge and the options the browser needs;
/// `verifyAuthentication()` takes the assertion back and returns a real
/// session, saves it, and fires `AuthChangeEvent.signedIn` — the same
/// ending `signInWithPassword` has. Nothing here signs a token and no
/// secret leaves the Supabase dashboard.
///
/// ## Four things have to be true before the button works
///
///   1. The console switch FOR THIS SURFACE is on. There are three of
///      them -- `signin_show_passkey` for the website,
///      `signin_show_passkey_ios` and `signin_show_passkey_android`
///      for the apps (`0638`) -- because the three surfaces need
///      three different things done to them and those are finished on
///      different days. `core/surface.dart` picks. All three ship
///      OFF, because of (2), and the apps have a (4) as well.
///   2. Passkeys are switched on for the project in the Supabase
///      dashboard. Until they are, GoTrue answers `passkey_disabled`
///      to every call, so a button drawn before that fails for
///      everybody who presses it.
///   3. This build and this browser can actually run the ceremony —
///      `passkeysUsable()`, which asks whether there is a
///      user-verifying authenticator on the machine.
///
///   4. On a phone only: the domain has to be ASSOCIATED with the
///      build. `assetlinks.json` on Android naming the package and
///      both signing certificates; an Associated Domains entitlement
///      plus `apple-app-site-association` on iOS. Neither of these is
///      in the app and neither can be checked from it before somebody
///      presses the button -- which is exactly why
///      `passkey_native.dart` turns the platform's refusal into a
///      sentence rather than letting it be a button that does
///      nothing. `docs/passkeys.md` is the list.
///
/// The first is a decision, the second is a dashboard switch, the
/// third is a fact about the device and the fourth is a file on a web
/// server. The first three are needed before the button is drawn, and
/// it is absent rather than disabled when any is missing: a disabled
/// control invites somebody to work out why, and there is nothing they
/// can do about any of these.
///
/// ## No identifier is typed
///
/// `startAuthentication` takes no email. The browser offers whichever
/// accounts have a passkey for this site and the person picks one, so
/// there is nothing to type and nothing to remember. That is the whole
/// point of it, and it is also why this cannot leak which addresses
/// exist: the question is never asked.
