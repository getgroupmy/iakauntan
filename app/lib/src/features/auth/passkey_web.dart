/// WebAuthn in a browser, in the shape GoTrue asks for.
///
/// `auth.passkey.startAuthentication()` hands back an `options` object
/// in the W3C `PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptionsJSON` form, and
/// `verifyAuthentication` wants the assertion back as
/// `AuthenticationResponseJSON`. Between those two the browser has to
/// be asked, and that is all this file does.
///
/// ## Why `js_interop_unsafe` and not `package:web`
///
/// `package:web` 1.1.1 binds `PublicKeyCredential` but not the two
/// static methods that make this tractable —
/// `parseRequestOptionsFromJSON` and `parseCreationOptionsFromJSON` —
/// nor the instance `toJSON()`. Those are what convert between the
/// JSON GoTrue speaks and the ArrayBuffers the browser wants.
///
/// Doing it without them means hand-rolling base64url to ArrayBuffer
/// in both directions over a structure with optional nested fields,
/// which is a lot of code to get subtly wrong in a place where "subtly
/// wrong" means a signature that will not verify. Calling the browser's
/// own converters through `js_interop_unsafe` is the smaller risk, and
/// it is the same approach `captcha_web.dart` and
/// `text_reader_web.dart` already take here.
///
/// ## What happens on a browser too old to have them
///
/// [passkeysUsable] returns false and the button is not drawn. Those
/// methods shipped in Chrome 119, Safari 17.4 and Firefox 119, so this
/// is a genuinely old browser — and one that cannot be supported
/// silently, because a half-working passkey is worse than an absent
/// one: it fails at the moment somebody is trying to get in.

///
/// Three questions, and all three have to be yes:
///
///   * `PublicKeyCredential` exists at all — no WebAuthn otherwise;
///   * it carries the JSON converters this file depends on.
///
/// ## What this deliberately does NOT ask
///
/// It used to also require
/// `isUserVerifyingPlatformAuthenticatorAvailable()` — "is there a
/// fingerprint reader, a face camera or a device PIN ON THIS MACHINE".
/// That was wrong, and wrong in the direction that hurts: it is the
/// question about the machine you happen to be sitting at, and a
/// passkey does not have to live there.
///
/// A browser with no platform authenticator can still offer, and every
/// one of these was hidden by that check:
///
///   * **iCloud Keychain / Apple Passwords**, on a Mac without Touch ID
///     and on any Mac where the passkey is meant to sync rather than
///     stay on the machine;
///   * **Google Password Manager**, which is where an Android user's
///     passkeys belong and which is reachable from a desktop browser;
///   * **a phone, by QR code** — the cross-device flow, which is the
///     whole answer for a shared or locked-down desktop;
///   * **a security key** on USB or NFC, which needs nothing built into
///     the machine at all.
///
/// So the question is only whether the browser can run the ceremony.
/// Whether there is anywhere to put the result is the BROWSER'S
/// chooser to present, and it knows about all four; this code does not,
/// and guessing on its behalf is what removed the options.
///
/// The cost of the looser test is a prompt somebody can cancel on a
/// machine with genuinely nothing available. That is a far smaller harm
/// than silently hiding the feature from everybody with an iPhone.
