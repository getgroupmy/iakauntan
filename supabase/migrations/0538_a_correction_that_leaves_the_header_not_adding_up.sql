-- =====================================================================
-- A correction that left the header not adding up
--
-- `prepare_einvoice` upserts the submission. When a document is filed a
-- second time — LHDN rejected it, somebody fixed it, it goes back — the
-- `do update` list decides which figures are refiled and which keep
-- what they said the first time.
--
-- It refreshed the amount before tax, the amount after it, the tax, the
-- rounding and the PAYABLE AMOUNT. It did not refresh the two figures
-- that sit between them: `total_charges` and `total_discount`.
--
-- So a shipping charge corrected between submissions produced a header
-- that contradicts itself. The payable amount moved and the charge that
-- moved it did not, which is exactly the fault 0410 fixed the first
-- time round, from the other end:
--
--     "Shipping alone left the header not adding up: LHDN was told
--      113.00 for a bill of 123.00, measured rather than reasoned
--      about."
--
-- A first submission has always been right. It is the second one that
-- was wrong, and only for a document somebody changed between the two —
-- which is every document that comes back rejected for a figure.
--
-- Nothing else changes. The buyer and supplier columns are deliberately
-- NOT refreshed and stay that way: a snapshot is what was filed, and a
-- customer who renamed itself last week did not rename itself on an
-- invoice issued last month.
