# What the database can do that nobody can reach

## The check

Every base table and every `public` function granted to `authenticated`,
counted against the Dart in `app/lib` and the Deno in
`supabase/functions`. Reproduce it with:

```sql
select 'table', table_name, null from information_schema.tables
 where table_schema = 'public' and table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
union all
select 'rpc', p.proname, pg_get_function_identity_arguments(p.oid)
  from pg_proc p join pg_namespace n on n.oid = p.pronamespace
 where n.nspname = 'public' and p.prokind = 'f'
   and has_function_privilege('authenticated', p.oid, 'execute');
```

then grep each name across both source trees.

Two traps in doing it naively, both hit on the first pass:

- **Searching only for `'quoted_name'` misses PostgREST embeds.** A table
  reached as `select('*, contacts(name, code)')` never appears in quotes.
  Search for the bare word as well.
- **A repository method that takes a table name as an argument hides
  every table it is called with.** `setupRows(table, …)` is one; here the
  call sites pass literals, so nothing was hidden, but the next such
  method might not.

A name appearing only inside a comment is not a reference. `create_gl_entry`
was exactly that case.

## Closed

- **The manual journal** (was gap 1). `post_manual_journal` in `0089`,
  reached from the Journals screen. `create_gl_entry` itself is no
  longer granted to `authenticated`: it takes the journal's source,
  source table and source id as arguments, so holding it let any
  signed-in user post an entry claiming to have come from a payroll run.
- **Posting an approved expense claim** (was gap 2). A Post action on
  the claims screen, and a switch on the claim itself so the choice
  between payroll reimbursement and posting by hand is made deliberately
  — `pay_with_payroll` defaulted to true and nothing ever set it, so
  every claim took the payroll route by accident and `post_expense_claim`
  would have refused all of them. Giving the function its first caller
  also gave it its first test, which found that proportional allocation
  rounded each share independently: three equal shares of an approved
  100.00 came to 99.99 against a credit of 100.00, and the journal was
  refused. Fixed in `0090`.
- **Public holidays and leave entitlement bands** (were gaps 1 and 2 of
  the second pass).
  Two tabs on the HR setup screen, plus `add_fixed_public_holidays` for
  the four Malaysian holidays that fall on a fixed date in every state
  and `apply_statutory_leave_bands` for the Employment Act 1955 floors.
  Both in `0091`.
- **The statutory rate tables** (was gap 3). Read-only for
  organizations, which is the design and not an omission — these tables
  have no `org_id`, so a rate edited by one company is every company's
  payroll. Publishing lives in the platform console behind
  `app.is_platform_admin()`.
- **Item prices** (was gap 4). A Prices action on each item, writing the
  named prices and quantity breaks `item_price` already resolves — plus
  an editor for `price_levels` themselves, which turned out to be
  readable and creatable by nothing, so the screen above it would have
  had nothing to price against.
- **Contact people and delivery addresses** (was gap 5). Two sections on
  a saved contact. `0092` adds the partial unique indexes that make
  "the default address" mean one row rather than whichever the query
  returns first.

## Correct: the database owns these

Not gaps. Written by triggers or SECURITY DEFINER functions, or read
through an RPC that *is* called:

`stock_movements`, `stock_levels`, `number_sequences`,
`opportunity_stage_history`, `payroll_ytd`, `platform_admins`,
`audit_logs` (via `audit_trail`), `corp_signatures`,
`corp_signature_requests`, `corp_signing_links`, `corp_filing_types` (all
via the `corp_*` RPCs), `einvoice_lines`, `einvoice_logs`,
`einvoice_submissions`, `tin_validations` (all from the edge functions).

## Gaps, worst first

### 1. CRM leads

`leads` has a table, RLS and no screen. The CRM is pipeline and
opportunities only, so the top of the funnel is missing.

### 2. Talent and onboarding

`interviews`, `onboarding_templates`, `onboarding_checklists`,
`onboarding_tasks`, `onboarding_template_items`, `appraisal_goals`,
`employee_dependants`, `employee_documents`, `employee_shifts` — all
unreachable. Appraisals and applicants have screens; the tables around
them do not.

### 3. Smaller, but real

- **`item_categories`** — no editor.
- **Stock card.** `stock_movements` cannot be inspected per item, so
  "why is this figure what it is" has no answer in the app.
- **Reconciliation history.** `bank_reconciliations` rows are written and
  never listed.
- **Depreciation schedule.** `depreciation_runs` and
  `depreciation_entries` are written by the run and never read, so the
  per-asset history the auditor asks for is not printable.
- **`corp_resolutions`** — the register itself, as opposed to the
  generated documents.
- **`corp_issued_capital`, `resync_bank_balance`** — RPCs with no caller.
- **Reference pickers**: `ref_countries`, `ref_msic_codes`,
  `ref_tax_types`, `ref_einvoice_types`, `ref_exemption_reasons` are
  typed by hand where they are used at all.

## Why this keeps happening

Of the eleven capabilities built in the sessions before this check, nine
were already in the schema with nothing able to reach them. Schema lands
ahead of behaviour in this codebase, consistently, and the gap is
invisible to every other check: the migrations apply, the tests pass,
the analyzer is clean, and the screens that exist all work.

Run this check before planning a block of work, not after.
